# processAPA
Process the data of an APA

Prepare the environment by issuing:
```
source /cvmfs/dune.opensciencegrid.org/products/dune/setup_dune.sh
setup dunesw v09_48_01d00 -q e20:prof
```
You can run those commands also by issuing `source setup.sh`

There is a sample file, `makePlot.py` showing how to look at the plots. This uses ROOT (http://root.cern.ch). Run in in the same terminal.
